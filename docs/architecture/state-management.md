# State Management

CDT uses a custom middleware pattern built on React Context and `useReducer`. There is no external state library — each domain owns its own context, reducer, and action types. All contexts are composed into a single `AppProvider` that wraps the application once.

## Pattern

Each store slice follows the same four-part structure:

### 1. State type

Defines the shape of the slice:

```ts
export type BuildingsState = {
  buildings: Building[]
  building: Building | null
}
```

### 2. Action types

A discriminated union of all actions the reducer handles:

```ts
export type BuildingsActions =
  | { type: 'SET_BUILDINGS'; payload: Building[] }
  | { type: 'SET_BUILDING'; payload: Building | null }
```

### 3. Reducer

Pure function — receives the current state and an action, returns the next state. Components never modify state directly.

```ts
export const BuildingsReducer = (
  state: BuildingsState,
  action: BuildingsActions
): BuildingsState => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_BUILDINGS':
      return { ...state, buildings: action.payload }
    case 'SET_BUILDING':
      return { ...state, building: action.payload }
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

### 4. Context and Provider

The context exposes `state` and `dispatch`. The provider wraps `useReducer` and passes both down:

```tsx
export const BuildingsContext = React.createContext<{
  state: InitialStateType
  dispatch: React.Dispatch<BuildingsActions>
}>({ state: initialState, dispatch: () => null })

export const BuildingsProvider: React.FC<React.PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState)
  return (
    <BuildingsContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </BuildingsContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

## Consuming a context

Import the context and destructure `state` and `dispatch` with `useContext`:

```tsx
import { MapStyleContext } from '@/core/store/Map/context'

export default function MapStyleMenu() {
  const { state, dispatch } = useContext(MapStyleContext)

  return (
    <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'UPDATE_MAP_STYLE', payload: { name: 'streets' } })}>
      Streets
    </button>
  )
}
```

Components dispatch actions — they never calculate the next state themselves.

## CombineProviders

All providers are composed into a single `AppProvider` using a `compose` utility in [`src/core/store/CombineProviders.tsx`](https://github.com/collabdt/core/blob/main/src/core/store/CombineProviders.tsx). This avoids deeply nested JSX while keeping each provider independent.

```tsx
const compose = providers =>
  providers.reduce(
    (Prev, Curr) =>
      function ComposedProvider({ children }) {
        return <Prev><Curr>{children}</Curr></Prev>
      }
  )

export const AppProvider = compose([
  AppConfigProvider,
  BimProvider,
  MapProvider,
  MenusProvider,
  ToolsProvider,
  ContentProvider,
  DatasetsProvider,
  FilesProvider,
  BuildingsProvider,
  PointCloudProvider,
  PermissionsProvider,
])
```

`AppProvider` is rendered once at the application root. All child components have access to every context without prop drilling.

## Providers

| Provider | Context key | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `AppConfigProvider` | `appConfig` | Active organization and current user |
| `BimProvider` | `bim` | IFC components, fragments, world, floor plans, BCF topics, model UI state |
| `MapProvider` | `map` | Map instance, style, camera position, layers, click/hover managers, GeoJSON |
| `MenusProvider` | `menus` | Active viewer, selected tab, sidebar panels, rows per page, visible sensors and comments |
| `ToolsProvider` | `tools` | Currently active tool ID |
| `ContentProvider` | `currentContent` | Active content view (`map`, `sites`, `buildings`, `files`, etc.) and instance |
| `DatasetsProvider` | `datasets` | Dataset list, selected dataset, added datasets |
| `FilesProvider` | `files` | File list, map file IDs, file manager open state, editing file |
| `BuildingsProvider` | `buildings` | Building list, selected building |
| `PointCloudProvider` | `pointcloud` | Point cloud viewer state |
| `PermissionsProvider` | `ability` | CASL ability object built from the user's role permissions |

## Key files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/core/store/CombineProviders.tsx` | Composes all providers into `AppProvider` |
| `src/core/store/ActionMap.ts` | Shared utility type for mapping action payloads |
| `src/core/store/<Domain>/context.tsx` | Context definition and provider for each slice |
| `src/core/store/<Domain>/reducer.ts` | State type, action types, and reducer for each slice |
| `src/core/store/index.ts` | Re-exports |

## Design decisions

- **No external library.** React Context + `useReducer` covers CDT's needs without the overhead of Redux or Zustand. The pattern is intentionally close to Redux (actions, reducers, dispatch) so it's familiar and easy to reason about.
- **One reducer per domain.** Each slice is fully self-contained. Adding a new domain means creating a `context.tsx` and `reducer.ts`, then registering the provider in `CombineProviders.tsx`.
- **`PermissionsProvider` is special.** It does not use `useReducer` — it reads the user's session via NextAuth and builds a CASL `MongoAbility` object from the fetched role permissions. It is memoized so the ability only rebuilds when permissions change.
- **`ContentProvider` is special.** It uses `useState` instead of `useReducer` because its state transitions are simple and don't benefit from the action/reducer pattern.
