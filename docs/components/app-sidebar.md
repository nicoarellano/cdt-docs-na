# AppSidebarContent

Renders the primary sidebar navigation for the CDT platform. Displays grouped menu items for 3D viewers (Map, BIM, Point Cloud), datasets (Sites, Buildings, Files, Infrastructure), and extensions. Adapts to organization-specific content restrictions, user roles, and collapsed/expanded sidebar states.

## Usage

```tsx
import { AppSidebarContent } from '@/components/AppSidebarContent';

<AppSidebarContent
  organization={organization}
  countrySubdivisionsData={countrySubdivisions}
/>
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `organization` | `Organization` | Yes | — | The current organization object containing name, logo, allowed viewers, and language settings. |
| `countrySubdivisionsData` | `Record<string, string>` | No | `undefined` | Mapping of country subdivision codes to names, used to populate map context. |

## Behaviour

- On mount, dispatches `SET_ORGANIZATION` to `AppConfigContext` and optionally `SET_COUNTRY_SUBDIVISIONS` to `MapContext`.
- Clicking a menu item calls `handleChangeViewer`, which resets selected item/site/file state, sets view to `'table'`, and updates `currentViewer` in menus state.
- Menu items are filtered by `organization.appContent` (if defined) and by user role via `accessibleTo`.
- Collapsed state hides text labels and centers icons; on mobile, the sidebar sheet open state determines layout.
- Footer displays language switcher (if organization supports multiple languages) and service links (e.g., support email).
- Active viewer is visually highlighted with primary color styling.

## Design Decisions

AppSidebarContent is responsible for navigation and organization context — it controls which viewers are available, who can see them, and dispatches the viewer change when a user clicks a menu item.

Menu items are defined as three static arrays (`viewerItems`, `datasetItems`, `managementItems`) rather than one flat list. This grouping maps directly to the three sidebar sections rendered in the UI, and makes it easy to add, remove, or reorder items within a section without affecting the others. Commented-out items (Land, Users, Feedback) are intentionally left in place as placeholders for features that are partially implemented or pending — removing them entirely would lose the context of where they belong.

Viewer availability is controlled by `appContent` on the Organization model. If `appContent` is empty, all viewers are shown; otherwise the list is filtered to only what the organization has enabled. This filtering happens at the item level via `.filter(item => appContent.includes(item.id))` so the sidebar automatically reflects each organization's configuration without any additional logic.

Role-based visibility is handled via the `accessibleTo` field on `MenuItem` and the `canRenderItem` callback, which checks the current user's role against the allowed roles for each item. This is intentionally separate from CASL — it controls whether a nav item is visible at all, while CASL controls what actions are available once inside a viewer.

The `handleChangeViewer` function is exported so it can be called from other parts of the app (e.g. map interactions, HeaderButtons) that need to trigger a viewer change without going through the sidebar directly. It always resets selected item, site, file, and view state to prevent stale detail views carrying over between viewers.

Collapsed/expanded state drives label visibility and layout adjustments throughout. On mobile, the sheet open state is treated as expanded so labels render correctly when the drawer is visible — this is handled by the `isCollapsed` derived value rather than reading `sidebarState` directly.

## Permissions

Menu items can be restricted by role using the `accessibleTo` property. Items are rendered only if the user's role matches one of the allowed roles.

```tsx
{
  title: t('users'),
  id: ViewerNames.users,
  accessibleTo: [RoleNames.admin],
  // ...
}
```
